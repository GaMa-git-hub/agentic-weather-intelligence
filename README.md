# 🌦️ Agentic Weather Intelligence System

An **agent-based AI system** that collects real-time weather data, analyzes patterns, and generates intelligent insights and alerts using autonomous decision-making.

This project is designed to demonstrate **agentic AI concepts**, clean system design, and real-world problem solving — making it suitable for internships, placements, and AI-focused roles.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

To build a **modular, scalable, agentic weather intelligence system** where autonomous agents:
- Observe weather data
- Reason over conditions
- Take decisions (alerts, recommendations)
- Collaborate with other agents

The system is designed to evolve from a **single intelligent agent** into a **multi-agent architecture**.

---

## 🧠 What Does “Agentic” Mean Here?

Unlike a normal script, this system:
- Maintains **state**
- Uses **tools** (APIs, analyzers)
- Makes **decisions**
- Can be extended to **multiple cooperating agents**

Example agents (planned):
- Weather Data Agent
- Weather Analysis Agent
- Alert & Recommendation Agent

---

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- 🌍 Real-time weather data ingestion
- 🧠 Intelligent weather analysis
- ⚠️ Automated alerts for extreme conditions
- 🔄 Agent state management
- 🧩 Modular and extensible architecture
- 📈 Easy future expansion (climate trends, forecasts, dashboards)
